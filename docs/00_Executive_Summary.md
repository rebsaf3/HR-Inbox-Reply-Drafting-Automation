# Executive Summary
This case study describes an HR shared inbox automation that drafts reply bodies using approved knowledge content only.

The goal is to reduce time spent on repetitive HR questions while keeping risk low. The automation does not send emails. It drafts reply content that a human or a downstream process can send after any required review.

Key outcomes
1. Faster first response for common HR questions
2. Consistent answers grounded in approved content
3. Reduced risk of policy invention through strict guardrails
4. Clear change control so updates do not create silent regressions

The design is intentionally simple and practical. It can be implemented with any workflow platform plus a knowledge store. The important part is the governance and the behavior constraints.
