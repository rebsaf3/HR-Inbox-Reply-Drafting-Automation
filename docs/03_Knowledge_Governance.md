# Knowledge Governance
Approved content must be curated. The workflow is only as good as the knowledge set.

Governance model
1. Owners: HR content owners approve and maintain resources
2. Routing map: a small glossary maps category keys to resources
3. Change control: every change has a ticket and a reviewer
4. Versioning: keep a change log with dates and summaries
5. Validation: run the test pack after every meaningful change

Minimum metadata per routing entry
1. Category
2. Subcategory, optional
3. Resource pointer
4. Status, active or inactive
5. Last reviewed date

Content lifecycle
1. Draft
2. Review
3. Approved
4. Published
5. Retired

Retired content must not be retrievable by the workflow.
