Hi,
Thanks for reaching out.

I can help point you to the approved resource for submitting a time off request. Please share which worker group or location you are part of, since submission steps can vary by group.

If you already know your standard HR portal or form location, use that channel to submit the request. If you are unsure, reply with your group and manager name and we will route you to the correct instructions.

Thank you,
HR Team
